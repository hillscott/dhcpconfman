# dhcpconfman
This perl script takes 3 arguments:
MAC-ADDRESS IP-ADDRESS USER-NAME
It then generates a host entry for dhcpd static reservations.
Of course you could manually add these, but this script is designed to prevent
fat fingering / breaking the config. 

It verifies that: 
- MAC-ADDRESS is a valid MAC
- IP-ADDRESS is a valid IP
- None of the 3 arguments already exist in the config

It also allows dynamic DNS domain assignment in the config, based off of a hash
mapping Classful Subnets to DNS domains. 


You will need to add a file: dhcpconfman.cfg to the code directory like so:
------ BEGIN EXAMPLE
$reservationsFile = "LOCATION OF THE RESERVATION FILE";
%dnsDomainMappings = (
    "10.10." => "localdomain1.org",
    "10.11." => "localdomain2.org"
);
------ END EXAMPLE
